-> to connect to the git ot github we have to create a new repo in the github and atach that url to the git repo

->command : git remote add origin (url)
-> git remote -v  (this will show what are the actions can we perform with this repo)


to push the git repo into the github repo we use the command 
command : git push origin master



(git stash) is a command is used to seperately store our personal file other than our main project in onearea and then if we want to take back to our staging then we have to use the (git stash pop) 
	
if we dont want that stash then we can delete the datas by using (git stash clear) will
